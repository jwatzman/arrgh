# Alternate Reddit Reader for Grazing Humans

A read-only Reddit browser, for people who, uh, graze Reddit on their phones from time to time, but don't need anywhere near a full-featured experience.

Alternatively, the sound you make when Reddit's own perfectly-good mobile experience blocks you from using it without signing in or using their app.

This is similar to a bunch of other offerings; part of the reason is that I wanted something most tuned to my needs, but also part of the reason is that it's just fun to build.
  - teddit: server-side and slow
  - i.reddit.com: doesn't allow sorting comments by Top, and also is old-looking and clunky (if otherwise functional)
  - reeddit: tries to be an actual Reddit client, which I don't need, and also hides vote counts, which are useful to see sometimes
